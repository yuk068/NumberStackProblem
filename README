NumberStackProblem
Given n = 3, we have 3 randomized vertical stacks
with a single empty node on top of all of them, detonated as "_":
_ _ _
3 2 1
2 1 3
1 2 3

You're able to move the very top element of a stack to any other available stack:
_ _ 3
_ 2 1
2 1 3
1 2 3

The very last number of the stacks is the base value and cannot be moved, the goal is to sort the stacks in a manner so that they only contain values equal to their respective base value:
_ _ _
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3

With n >= 3, this matrix will have a size of n + 1 x n,
Can this problem always be solved with n >= 3 ? If yes, implement an algorithm to solve this problem with n >= 3 (Some what similar to Tower of Hanoi).
